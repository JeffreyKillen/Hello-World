# Hello-World
Exploratory repository to learn GitHub 

I am a student with University of Maryland, University College.
I am working on a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a Math minor.
I just finished Data Structures and Analysis, and found that I love programming.
I am here to learn how GitHub works.

You?
